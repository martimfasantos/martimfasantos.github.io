This research was supervised by \u003cstrong\u003eAndré F.T. Martins\u003c/strong\u003e, Head of Research at Unbabel, and \u003cstrong\u003eSweta Agrawal\u003c/strong\u003e, a postdoctoral researcher at Instituto de Telecomunicações, in collaboration with Unbabel and SARDINE Lab.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"thesis-overview\"\u003eThesis Overview\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLarge language models (LLMs) are capable of generating human-like text and learning vast world knowledge. However, these models sometimes produce misleading or toxic content, highlighting the need to align them with human values for safer and more effective AI systems. Traditionally, the widely used \u003cstrong\u003eReinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)\u003c/strong\u003e method has been a go-to strategy for improving this alignment, as seen in models like \u003cstrong\u003eGPT-3.5\u003c/strong\u003e and \u003cstrong\u003eGPT-4\u003c/strong\u003e. However, RLHF is complex, unstable, and highly sensitive to hyperparameters, making it difficult to apply universally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo address these issues, several \u003cstrong\u003ereinforcement learning-free (RL-free)\u003c/strong\u003e approaches like \u003cstrong\u003eDPO\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003eCPO\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003eSimPO\u003c/strong\u003e, and \u003cstrong\u003eSLiC\u003c/strong\u003e have been proposed. My thesis investigates whether the promising results of these RL-free methods seen in larger models can be replicated in \u003cstrong\u003esmall language models (SLMs)\u003c/strong\u003e. Specifically, I focus on \u003cstrong\u003emachine translation\u003c/strong\u003e and \u003cstrong\u003esummarization\u003c/strong\u003e tasks and assess how well these methods help the models learn human preferences, avoid common biases, and generate high-quality outputs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"methodology-and-models-used\"\u003eMethodology and Models Used\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn my study, I trained three compact language models — \u003cstrong\u003eTinyLlama 1.1B\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003eGemma-2 2B\u003c/strong\u003e, and \u003cstrong\u003eEuroLLM 1.7B\u003c/strong\u003e — using several RL-free methods. I compared their performance against baseline models to determine the effectiveness of these approaches for smaller-scale LLMs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis \u003cstrong\u003ework is the first to comprehensively compare various feedback methods applied to state-of-the-art small language models\u003c/strong\u003e, contributing to the development of more accessible and secure AI systems that can run effectively in resource-constrained environments.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"conclusion\"\u003eConclusion\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy evaluating these models and feedback methods, my research sheds light on how RL-free techniques can be a viable alternative to RLHF for improving model alignment with human values, even in smaller-scale models. This is a step toward building more reliable AI systems that can better serve the needs of users in real-world applications.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n","description":null,"image":null,"permalink":"http://martimfasantos.github.io/blog/thesis/","title":"My MSc Thesis: Aligning Language Models with Human Feedback without Reinforcement Learning"},{"content":"\u003ch2 id=\"a-memorable-start-to-my-career\"\u003eA Memorable Start to My Career\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis summer, I had the incredible opportunity to begin my professional journey as an \u003cstrong\u003eApprentice Backend Developer\u003c/strong\u003e at \u003cstrong\u003eSky Portugal\u003c/strong\u003e.
