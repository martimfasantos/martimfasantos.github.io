      <description>Recently, I successfully defended my MSc Degree in Computer Science and Engineering Thesis on Aligning Language Models with Human Feedback without Reinforcement Learning. This research was supervised by AndrÃ© F.T. Martins, Head of Research at Unbabel, and Sweta Agrawal, postdoctoral researcher at Instituto de TelecomunicaÃ§Ãµes, in collaboration Unbabel and SARDINE Lab.
Thesis Overview Large language models (LLMs) are capable of generating human-like text and learning vast world knowledge. However, these models sometimes produce misleading or toxic content, highlighting the need to align them with human values for safer and more effective AI systems.</description>
